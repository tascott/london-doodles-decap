    - title: Our Home Breeding
      content: >
        Our puppies are home raised, born in our bedroom, then move downstairs
        to the hub of the home. We like them to be fully immersed in a normal
        home environment. The start of a puppy's life is a hugely important
        aspect in creating a stable family dog.

      content: We have been working as a family on our lines for over 10 years, but we
        are still working towards our goal, by adding new lines and opening the
        gene pool to create stronger lines.

    description: It is our job to ensure our puppies are in forever homes, so as
      part of that, it is essential to try and match the right puppy to the
      right home. Please do not be offended if we do not think you are suitable
      for one of our puppies.

aboutUs:
  title: A little bit about us
  description: >+
    We breed our dogs with an aim and focus on sound temperament and healthy
    genetics. Most dogs now serve the purpose of companionship, and we believe
    dogs placed in non-working homes should be bred to be suitable for a home
    environment. We focus on working towards a calm dog at home but enjoys
    exercise and training. Each puppy and dog is different, so we try to choose
    the right puppy for the right home. We have had great success over the years
    with puppies becoming registered therapy dogs, medical assistance dogs,
    school dogs (and even one nursery dog). Even without official recognition,
    we have a large number of dogs that are placed in homes with adults or
    children with additional needs including autism and other SEN requirements.
