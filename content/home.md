    - title: Our Home Breeding
      content: >
        Our puppies are home raised, born in our bedroom, then move downstairs to the hub of the home. We like them to be fully
        immersed in a normal home environment. The start of a puppy's life is a hugely important aspect in creating a stable family dog.

        We have been working as a family on our lines for nearly 10 years, but we are still working towards our goal, by adding new lines
        and opening the gene pool to create stronger lines.
