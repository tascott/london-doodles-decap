      content: >
        Our puppies are home raised, born in our bedroom, then move downstairs to the hub of the home. We like them to be fully
        immersed in a normal home environment. The start of a puppy's life is a hugely important aspect in creating a stable family dog.

        We have been working as a family on our lines for nearly 10 years, but we are still working towards our goal, by adding new lines
        and opening the gene pool to create stronger lines.

    Here at London Doodles we believe good dogs are about as close as we can come to knowing the
    spirit of God on earth. When you buy a dog from us, you are not only getting a puppy but a life long
    journey into the life of a Labradoodle and all the love that comes with it. We are always on hand to
