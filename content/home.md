    - title: Our Home Breeding
      content: >
        Our puppies are home raised, born in our bedroom, then move downstairs
        to the hub of the home. We like them to be fully immersed in a normal
        home environment. The start of a puppy's life is a hugely important
        aspect in creating a stable family dog.

    - title: Our Experience
      content: >
        We have been working as a family on our lines for nearly 10 years, but
        we are still working towards our goal, by adding new lines and opening
        the gene pool to create stronger lines.

        Our aim is to achieve the type of Australian Labradoodle with our own
