    - title: Home Breeding
      content: All of our puppies are born in our bedroom and, as they grow, are moved
        to the bustling centre of our home. We believe in fully immersing them
        in a typical family environment from the very beginning.

    - title: The difference
      content: Our puppies are lucky to enjoy plenty of space to play and explore. As
        a family, we run a training and walking facility just a short distance
        from our home, set on 8.5 acres of beautiful natural fields. Once the
        puppies are old enough, they join us there daily for fresh air,
        stimulation, and supervised adventures. This early exposure to the
        outdoors and varied environments helps build confident, well-rounded
        dogs who are ready to take on the world with their new families.

    - title: Our Goal
      content: For over 12 years we have been breeding our own lines of Australian
        type Labradoodles. With a focus on temperament we have been breeding to
        improve the health and genetics of our dogs. We are still working
        towards our goal, by adding new lines and opening the gene pool to
        create stronger lines.

    description: >-
      The first weeks of a puppy’s life are crucial for shaping their future
      temperament. Being surrounded by the everyday sights, sounds, and rhythms
      of family life helps them develop into confident, well-adjusted dogs,
      ready to settle seamlessly into their forever homes.

      We never use kennels or outbuildings—our puppies are raised exactly where they belong: right alongside us, as part of the family along with our children, other dogs and cat.

  - title: Health Testing
    description: All of our dogs are DNA tested for a comprehensive list of
      conditions. We test for well over the minimum required for the breeds used
      to make Australian Labradoodles. For our large labradoodles parents are
      also hip and elbow scored. Puppies will all be seen by a vet before they
      leave for a full health check, and prescribed prescription flea and worm
      treatments as well. You will receive a sales contract highlighting the
      tests and health checks, and a guarantee of health.

  - title: Puppy Matching
    description: >-
      Our top priority is placing each puppy in a loving, forever home that
      suits their individual needs and personality. Every puppy is unique, so we
      take great care in matching the right puppy with the right home.

      Some of our puppies go on to become therapy dogs, which requires specific temperaments and traits. In these cases, we match them with families who need those characteristics.

      Please don’t take it personally if we feel one of our puppies may not be the right fit for your household. This is never a reflection on you, but a commitment to the long-term wellbeing of our dogs, and it may be that a later litter will suit you better.

  - title: Feeding
    description: >-
      We naturally wean our puppies from their mother’s milk for a stress free
      transition for both mum and pups. Their first introduction to solid food
      is with finely minced raw dog food, gradually moving to chunkier blends
      similar to what our adult dogs enjoy.

      We believe in feeding a natural, species-appropriate diet and use only age-appropriate, natural treats to support sensory development. Chewing on larger, safe chews not only satisfies their natural instincts but also helps them relax and self-soothe.

      If you prefer to feed a different diet, we’re happy to discuss options with you and will do our best to accommodate your preferences before your puppy goes home.

    description: >-
      Our commitment to you and your puppy doesn’t end when they leave our home.
      We’re here for you throughout your dog’s entire life—whether you need
      advice on training, grooming, nutrition, or simply have a question along
      the way..

      We absolutely love receiving updates and watching our puppies grow and thrive with their new families—it’s one of the most rewarding parts of what we do.

      Should your circumstances ever change, we will always welcome one of our dogs back into our care—no matter their age. All of our puppies’ microchips are dual registered to us as an added safeguard, ensuring that if any of them ever end up in rescue or picked up by a dog warden we can help to reunite.

aboutUs:
  title: A little bit about us
  description: >
    We’re Anne and Amy, a mother-and-daughter team with over 12 years of
    experience in dog breeding. Dogs have always been a central part of our
    family life, and our journey began with our beloved purebred Labradors.
    Sadly, we lost several to cancer—a common outcome linked to the limited gene
    pool in many purebred dogs.


    This experience led us to explore breeds with greater genetic diversity and more robust health. That’s when we discovered the Australian Labradoodle—and fell in love with the concept. We’ve built our breeding program from the ground up, using only our own carefully developed lines. Our dogs’ pedigrees include a mix of American and English Cocker Spaniel, Labrador, Toy, Miniature, and Standard Poodle—with some lines also incorporating Golden Retriever. This thoughtful blend supports both health and temperament, offering a wide gene pool and consistent, well-balanced personalities.


    We breed with intention. Our goal is to raise dogs with sound temperaments and strong, healthy genetics—ideally suited for modern family life. While many of our puppies go on to be beloved companions, several have also become registered therapy dogs, medical assistance dogs, school support animals—and even one adored nursery dog.


    Many of our dogs are placed with families who have children or adults with additional needs, including autism and other SEN requirements. Whether they carry a formal title or not, these dogs make a real difference in people’s lives—and that’s exactly what we’re here for.
