    - title: Home Breeding
      content: All of our puppies are born in our bedroom and, as they grow, are moved
        to the bustling centre of our home. We believe in fully immersing them
        in a typical family environment from the very beginning.

    description: >-
      The first weeks of a puppy’s life are crucial for shaping their future
      temperament. Being surrounded by the everyday sights, sounds, and rhythms
      of family life helps them develop into confident, well-adjusted dogs,
      ready to settle seamlessly into their forever homes.

      We never use kennels or outbuildings—our puppies are raised exactly where they belong: right alongside us, as part of the family along with our children, other dogs and cat.

aboutUs:
  title: A little bit about us
  description: >+
    We breed our dogs with an aim and focus on sound temperament and healthy
    genetics. Most dogs now serve the purpose of companionship, and we believe
    dogs placed in non-working homes should be bred to be suitable for a home
    environment. We focus on working towards a calm dog at home but enjoys
    exercise and training. Each puppy and dog is different, so we try to choose
    the right puppy for the right home. We have had great success over the years
    with puppies becoming registered therapy dogs, medical assistance dogs,
    school dogs (and even one nursery dog). Even without official recognition,
    we have a large number of dogs that are placed in homes with adults or
    children with additional needs including autism and other SEN requirements.
