    - title: Home Breeding
      content: All of our puppies are born in our bedroom and, as they grow, are moved
        to the bustling centre of our home. We believe in fully immersing them
        in a typical family environment from the very beginning.

    - title: Our Experience
      content: We have been working as a family on our lines for over 10 years, but we
        are still working towards our goal, by adding new lines and opening the
        gene pool to create stronger lines.

    - title: Our Goal

  - title: Home Raised
    description: >-
      The first weeks of a puppy’s life are crucial for shaping their future
      temperament. Being surrounded by the everyday sights, sounds, and rhythms
      of family life helps them develop into confident, well-adjusted dogs,
      ready to settle seamlessly into their forever homes.

      We never use kennels or outbuildings—our puppies are raised exactly where they belong: right alongside us, as part of the family along with our children, other dogs and cat.

  - title: Health Testing
    description: All of our dogs are DNA tested for a comprehensive list of
      conditions. We test for well over the minimum required for the breeds used
      to make Australian Labradoodles. For our large labradoodles parents are
      also hip and elbow scored. Puppies will all be seen by a vet before they
      leave for a full health check, and prescribed prescription flea and worm
      treatments as well. You will receive a sales contract highlighting the
      tests and health checks, and a guarantee of health.

  - title: Puppy Matching
    description: >-
      Our top priority is placing each puppy in a loving, forever home that
      suits their individual needs and personality. Every puppy is unique, so we
      take great care in matching the right puppy with the right home.

      Some of our puppies go on to become therapy dogs, which requires specific temperaments and traits. In these cases, we match them with families who need those characteristics.

      Please don’t take it personally if we feel one of our puppies may not be the right fit for your household. This is never a reflection on you, but a commitment to the long-term wellbeing of our dogs, and it may be that a later litter will suit you better.

  - title: Feeding
    description: >-
      We naturally wean our puppies from their mother’s milk for a stress free
      transition for both mum and pups. Their first introduction to solid food
      is with finely minced raw dog food, gradually moving to chunkier blends
      similar to what our adult dogs enjoy.

      We believe in feeding a natural, species-appropriate diet and use only age-appropriate, natural treats to support sensory development. Chewing on larger, safe chews not only satisfies their natural instincts but also helps them relax and self-soothe.

      If you prefer to feed a different diet, we’re happy to discuss options with you and will do our best to accommodate your preferences before your puppy goes home.

      Sales contract

  - title: Lifetime support
    description: >-
      Our commitment to you and your puppy doesn’t end when they leave our home.
      We’re here for you throughout your dog’s entire life—whether you need
      advice on training, grooming, nutrition, or simply have a question along
      the way..

      We absolutely love receiving updates and watching our puppies grow and thrive with their new families—it’s one of the most rewarding parts of what we do.

      Should your circumstances ever change, we will always welcome one of our dogs back into our care—no matter their age. All of our puppies’ microchips are dual registered to us as an added safeguard, ensuring that if any of them ever end up in rescue or picked up by a dog warden we can help to reunite.

aboutUs:
  title: A little bit about us
  description: >+
    We breed our dogs with an aim and focus on sound temperament and healthy
    genetics. Most dogs now serve the purpose of companionship, and we believe
    dogs placed in non-working homes should be bred to be suitable for a home
    environment. We focus on working towards a calm dog at home but enjoys
    exercise and training. Each puppy and dog is different, so we try to choose
    the right puppy for the right home. We have had great success over the years
    with puppies becoming registered therapy dogs, medical assistance dogs,
    school dogs (and even one nursery dog). Even without official recognition,
    we have a large number of dogs that are placed in homes with adults or
    children with additional needs including autism and other SEN requirements.
