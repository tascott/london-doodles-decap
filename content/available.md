  title: Small Miniature Labradoodles Due Soon
  description: >-
    We are imminently due a little of small miniature / toy sized labradoodle
    puppies. These are not Australian Labradoodles.


    Mum is a beuatiful deep brown and dad is our lovely toy poodle Dylan. Puppies will have lovely soft, non shedding coats. This is going to be a very small litter so early interest is essential. Puppies will be read for their new homes in January. All puppies will be chocolate in colour.


    Fully DNA tested for an extensive list of over 150 conditions.


    Raied in our family home, with other dogs, children, our cat and the daily business of our life. Once old enough they will start coming with us to our private fields to work on basic training and socialisation.


    Raised on either raw or butternut (new owners preference) they will be have the best start in life. We use food as part of their early training and mental engagement.
