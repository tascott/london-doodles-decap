  title: Small Miniature Labradoodles
  description: >-
    Due to a massive time waster, one puppy is suddenly looking for his forever
    home. He is a lovely apricot toy / mini labradoodle. With a lovely soft non
    shedding coat, he is excelling at toilet training, and waits in the morning
    for me to let him into the garden. Raised on raw and butternut box they are
    eating well and full of beans. 


    They have had the unique experience of being raised around my puppy-obsessed 8-month-old daughter, who will do anything to break into the pen to be with them. So they spend a lot of time in the kitchen being hugged by her. They are very well desensitised to the usual hustle of a very busy family home and are not phased at all by the TV, hoover, or a toddler's meltdown. They are great at being washed, brushed, blow-dried, and having trims and nail clips. 

    He has had his first vaccination and some socialisation, but they are already very used to other dogs, including our very big mastiff. He is ready for his new sofa to lie on!
