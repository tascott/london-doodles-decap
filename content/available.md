  description: >-
    A close friend of ours is due a small litter of toy yorkiepoos in October,
    ready for their new homes mid December. These are from fully DNA tested
    dogs, we bred their grandma, and their great grandma! We know the lines very
    well and the breeder.


    They will be raised around children and follow a similar early neurological stimulation programme as ours. These are toy-sized puppies, so expect around 2 to 3kg when they are fully grown. With beautiful non shedding coats. 


    Photos of previous litter are below. Puppies will leave with a full puppy pack of food, insurance, vet checks, toys, blankets. Puppies are Â£3000
