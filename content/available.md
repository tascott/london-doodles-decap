    Molly’s Puppies – Thriving and Ready for Visits


    Molly has done a wonderful job raising her second and final litter, and we couldn’t be prouder of how beautifully her puppies are developing. Now at 6 weeks old, they’re thriving—and we’re excited to begin welcoming visits from prospective families.


    Thanks to the lovely weather, they’ve made great progress with toilet training. They’re already clean overnight and wait patiently to be let outside in the morning.


    They’ve been enjoying daily adventures in our fields, exploring long grass, bushes, and trees—always with their mum close by. Being raised alongside our toddler and newborn means they’re well accustomed to a busy household and completely unfazed by noise or activity.


    These puppies are showing calm, confident temperaments and are already demonstrating wonderful potential for future therapy or support roles.
